--------Robot Controls By Button-------
>>>>>>bumpers and triggers<<<<<<
R1,BumperTopRight(Right Bumper) = nothing
R2,BumperBottomRight(Right Trigger) = shoot while held
L1,BumperTopLeft(Left Bumper) = auto drive test: align to 90* @ full speed
L2,BumperBottomLeft(Left Trigger) = print last_dip

>>>>>>center buttons<<<<<<
Start:
when pressed = open gear manipulator
when released = close gear manipulator

Back = turret vision while held
mode = switch joystick and d-pad

>>>>>>right buttons<<<<<<
Y = outtake while held
B = spin up shooter while held
A = Intake in while held
X = nothing

>>>>>>D-Pad<<<<<<
D-Pad:
Left(pov=270) = turret full left
Up(pov=0) = align turret with center shot
Right(pov=90) = turret full right
Down(pov=180) = align turret with off shot
center = pov=-1 = nothing
>>>>>>joystick buttons and axis<<<<<<
left joystick horizontal axis(0) = turret slow fudge
left joystick vertical axis(1) = nothing
left joystick center button(11?) = nothing
right joystick horizontal axis(2) = turret fast fudge
right joystick vertical axis(3) = nothing
right joystick center button(12?) = nothing
